        <span>
            <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that, besides <span style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Aquinas uses 'philosophical' in the scholastic sense, meaning pertaining to reason.">philosophical</span> science, we have no
            need of any further knowledge. For man should not seek to know what is
            above reason: "Seek not the things that are too high for thee"
            (Ecclus. 3:22). But whatever is not above reason is fully treated of
            in philosophical science. Therefore any other knowledge besides
            philosophical science is superfluous.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>Reply Obj. 1:</i></b> Although those things which are beyond man's
            knowledge may not be sought for by man through his reason,
            nevertheless, once they are revealed by God, they must be accepted by
            faith. Hence the sacred text continues, "For many things are shown to
            thee above the understanding of man" (Ecclus. 3:25). And in this, the
            sacred science consists.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, knowledge can be concerned only with being, for
            nothing can be known, save what is true; and all that is, is true. But
            everything that is, is treated of in philosophical science--even God
            Himself; so that there is a part of philosophy called theology, or the
            divine science, as Aristotle has proved (Metaph. vi). Therefore,
            besides philosophical science, there is no need of any further
            knowledge.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>Reply Obj. 1:</i></b> Sciences are differentiated according to the
            various means through which knowledge is obtained. For the astronomer
            and the physicist both may prove the same conclusion: that the earth,
            for instance, is round: the astronomer by means of mathematics (i.e.
            abstracting from matter), but the physicist by means of matter itself.
            Hence there is no reason why those things which may be learned from
            philosophical science, so far as they can be known by natural reason,
            may not also be taught us by another science so far as they fall
            within revelation. Hence theology included in sacred doctrine differs
            in kind from that theology which is part of philosophy.

        <summary>Aquinas' Arguments</summary>
        <span>
            <b><i>Sed contra</i></b>, It is written (2 Tim. 3:16): "All Scripture inspired
            of God is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in
            justice." Now Scripture, inspired of God, is no part of philosophical
            science, which has been built up by human reason. Therefore it is
            useful that besides philosophical science, there should be other
            knowledge, i.e. inspired of God.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b><i>Respondeo</i></b>, It was necessary for man's salvation that there should
            be a knowledge revealed by God besides philosophical science built up
            by human reason. Firstly, indeed, because man is directed to God, as
            to an end that surpasses the grasp of his reason: "The eye hath not
            seen, O God, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them
            that wait for Thee" (Isa. 66:4). But the end must first be known by men
            who are to direct their thoughts and actions to the end. Hence it was
            necessary for the salvation of man that certain truths which exceed
            human reason should be made known to him by divine revelation. Even as
            regards those truths about God which human reason could have
            discovered, it was necessary that man should be taught by a divine
            revelation; because the truth about God such as reason could discover,
            would only be known by a few, and that after a long time, and with the
            admixture of many errors. Whereas man's whole salvation, which is in
            God, depends upon the knowledge of this truth. Therefore, in order
            that the salvation of men might be brought about more fitly and more
            surely, it was necessary that they should be taught divine truths by
            divine revelation. It was therefore necessary that besides
            philosophical science built up by reason, there should be a sacred
            science learned through revelation.

    SECOND ARTICLE [I, Q. 1, Art. 2]

    Whether Sacred Doctrine Is a Science?

    Objection 1: It seems that sacred doctrine is not a science. For every
    science proceeds from self-evident principles. But sacred doctrine
    proceeds from articles of faith which are not self-evident, since
    their truth is not admitted by all: "For all men have not faith" (2
    Thess. 3:2). Therefore sacred doctrine is not a science.

    Obj. 2: Further, no science deals with individual facts. But this
    sacred science treats of individual facts, such as the deeds of
    Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and such like. Therefore sacred doctrine is
    not a science.

    _On the contrary,_ Augustine says (De Trin. xiv, 1) "to this science
    alone belongs that whereby saving faith is begotten, nourished,
    protected and strengthened." But this can be said of no science except
    sacred doctrine. Therefore sacred doctrine is a science.

    _I answer that,_ Sacred doctrine is a science. We must bear in mind that
    there are two kinds of sciences. There are some which proceed from a
    principle known by the natural light of intelligence, such as
    arithmetic and geometry and the like. There are some which proceed
    from principles known by the light of a higher science: thus the
    science of perspective proceeds from principles established by
    geometry, and music from principles established by arithmetic. So it
    is that sacred doctrine is a science because it proceeds from
    principles established by the light of a higher science, namely, the
    science of God and the blessed. Hence, just as the musician accepts on
    authority the principles taught him by the mathematician, so sacred
    science is established on principles revealed by God.

    Reply Obj. 1: The principles of any science are either in
    themselves self-evident, or reducible to the conclusions of a higher
    science; and such, as we have said, are the principles of sacred
    doctrine.

    Reply Obj. 2: Individual facts are treated of in sacred
    doctrine, not because it is concerned with them principally, but they
    are introduced rather both as examples to be followed in our lives (as
    in moral sciences) and in order to establish the authority of those
    men through whom the divine revelation, on which this sacred scripture
    or doctrine is based, has come down to us.

    THIRD ARTICLE [I, Q. 1, Art. 3]

    Whether Sacred Doctrine Is One Science?

    Objection 1: It seems that sacred doctrine is not one science; for
    according to the Philosopher (Poster. i) "that science is one which
    treats only of one class of subjects." But the creator and the
    creature, both of whom are treated of in sacred doctrine, cannot be
    grouped together under one class of subjects. Therefore sacred
    doctrine is not one science.

    Obj. 2: Further, in sacred doctrine we treat of angels, corporeal
    creatures and human morality. But these belong to separate
    philosophical sciences. Therefore sacred doctrine cannot be one
    science.

    _On the contrary,_ Holy Scripture speaks of it as one science: "Wisdom
    gave him the knowledge [scientiam] of holy things" (Wis. 10:10).

    _I answer that,_ Sacred doctrine is one science. The unity of a faculty
    or habit is to be gauged by its object, not indeed, in its material
    aspect, but as regards the precise formality under which it is an
    object. For example, man, ass, stone agree in the one precise
    formality of being colored; and color is the formal object of sight.
    Therefore, because Sacred Scripture considers things precisely under
    the formality of being divinely revealed, whatever has been divinely
    revealed possesses the one precise formality of the object of this
    science; and therefore is included under sacred doctrine as under one
    science.

    Reply Obj. 1: Sacred doctrine does not treat of God and
    creatures equally, but of God primarily, and of creatures only so far
    as they are referable to God as their beginning or end. Hence the
    unity of this science is not impaired.

    Reply Obj. 2: Nothing prevents inferior faculties or habits
    from being differentiated by something which falls under a higher
    faculty or habit as well; because the higher faculty or habit regards
    the object in its more universal formality, as the object of the
    _common sense_ is whatever affects the senses, including, therefore,
    whatever is visible or audible. Hence the _common sense,_ although one
    faculty, extends to all the objects of the five senses. Similarly,
    objects which are the subject-matter of different philosophical
    sciences can yet be treated of by this one single sacred science under
    one aspect precisely so far as they can be included in revelation. So
    that in this way, sacred doctrine bears, as it were, the stamp of the
    divine science which is one and simple, yet extends to everything.
