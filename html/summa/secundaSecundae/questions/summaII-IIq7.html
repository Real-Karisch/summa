    <h1>QUESTION 7</h1>
    <h2>OF THE EFFECTS OF FAITH (In Two Articles)
</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  <br />
  We must now consider the effects of faith: under which head there

  are two points of inquiry:

  <br />
  (1) Whether fear is an effect of faith?

  <br />
  (2) Whether the heart is purified by faith?

            </i>
          </b>
          It would seem that fear is not an effect of faith. For an effect does not precede its cause. Now fear precedes faith: for it
 is written (Ecclus. 2:8): "Ye that fear the Lord, believe in Him."
 Therefore fear is not an effect of faith.

          </b>
          Fear of God cannot altogether precede faith, because if we knew nothing at all about Him, with regard to rewards and
 punishments, concerning which faith teaches us, we should nowise fear
 Him. If, however, faith be presupposed in reference to certain
 articles of faith, for example the Divine excellence, then
 reverential fear follows, the result of which is that man submits his
 intellect to God, so as to believe in all the Divine promises. Hence
 the text quoted continues: "And your reward shall not be made void."

          </b>
          Further, the same thing is not the cause of contraries. Now fear and hope are contraries, as stated above (I-II, Q. 23, A. 2):
 and faith begets hope, as a gloss observes on Matt. 1:2. Therefore
 fear is not an effect of faith.

          </b>
          The same thing in respect of contraries can be the cause of contraries, but not under the same aspect. Now faith begets
 hope, in so far as it enables us to appreciate the prize which God
 awards to the just, while it is the cause of fear, in so far as it
 makes us appreciate the punishments which He intends to inflict on
 sinners.

          </b>
          Further, one contrary does not cause another. Now the object of faith is a good, which is the First Truth, while the object of
 fear is an evil, as stated above (I-II, Q. 42, A. 1). Again, acts
 take their species from the object, according to what was stated
 above (I-II, Q. 18, A. 2). Therefore faith is not a cause of fear.

          </b>
          The primary and formal object of faith is the good which is the First Truth; but the material object of faith includes
 also certain evils; for instance, that it is an evil either not to
 submit to God, or to be separated from Him, and that sinners will
 suffer penal evils from God: in this way faith can be the cause of
 fear.

          </b>
          Fear is a movement of the appetitive power, as

          stated above (I-II, Q. 41, A. 1). Now the principle of all appetitive
 movements is the good or evil apprehended: and consequently the
 principle of fear and of every appetitive movement must be an
 apprehension. Again, through faith there arises in us an apprehension
 of certain penal evils, which are inflicted in accordance with the
 Divine judgment. In this way, then, faith is a cause of the fear
 whereby one dreads to be punished by God; and this is servile fear.
 
 It is also the cause of filial fear, whereby one dreads to be
 separated from God, or whereby one shrinks from equalling oneself to
 Him, and holds Him in reverence, inasmuch as faith makes us appreciate
 God as an unfathomable and supreme good, separation from which is the
 greatest evil, and to which it is wicked to wish to be equalled. Of
 the first fear, viz. servile fear, lifeless faith is the cause, while
 living faith is the cause of the second, viz. filial fear, because it
 makes man adhere to God and to be subject to Him by charity.

Whether Faith Has the Effect of Purifying the Heart?

          It would seem that faith does not purify the heart. For purity of the heart pertains chiefly to the affections, whereas faith
 is in the intellect. Therefore faith has not the effect of purifying
 the heart.

          Things that are in the intellect are the principles of those which are in the appetite, in so far as the apprehended good
 moves the appetite.

          Further, that which purifies the heart is incompatible with impurity. But faith is compatible with the impurity of sin, as may be
 seen in those who have lifeless faith. Therefore faith does not
 purify the heart.

          </b>
          Even lifeless faith excludes a certain impurity which is contrary to it, viz. that of error, and which consists in the
 human intellect, adhering inordinately to things below itself,
 through wishing to measure Divine things by the rule of sensible
 objects. But when it is quickened by charity, then it is incompatible
 with any kind of impurity, because "charity covereth all sins" (Prov.
 10:12).

          Further, if faith were to purify the human heart in any way, it would chiefly purify the intellect of man. Now it does not purify
 the intellect from obscurity, since it is a veiled knowledge.
 Therefore faith nowise purifies the heart.

          The obscurity of faith does not pertain to the impurity of sin, but rather to the natural defect of the human intellect,
 according to the present state of life.

          Peter said (Acts 15:9): "Purifying their hearts by

          faith."

          A thing is impure through being mixed with baser

          things: for silver is not called impure, when mixed with gold, which
 betters it, but when mixed with lead or tin. Now it is evident that
 the rational creature is more excellent than all transient and
 corporeal creatures; so that it becomes impure through subjecting
 itself to transient things by loving them. From this impurity the
 rational creature is purified by means of a contrary movement,
 namely, by tending to that which is above it, viz. God. The first
 beginning of this movement is faith: since "he that cometh to God
 must believe that He is," according to Heb. 11:6. Hence the first
 beginning of the heart's purifying is faith; and if this be perfected
 through being quickened by charity, the heart will be perfectly
 purified thereby.
