    <h1>QUESTION 107</h1>
    <h2>OF INGRATITUDE (In Four Articles)
</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  <br />
  We must now consider ingratitude, under which head there are four

  points of inquiry:

  <br />
  (1) Whether ingratitude is always a sin?

  <br />
  (2) Whether ingratitude is a special sin?

  <br />
  (3) Whether every act of ingratitude is a mortal sin?

  <br />
  (4) Whether favors should be withdrawn from the ungrateful?

  <br />

          </b>
          It seems that ingratitude is not always a sin. For Seneca says (De Benef. iii) that "he who does not repay a favor is
 ungrateful." But sometimes it is impossible to repay a favor without
 sinning, for instance if one man has helped another to commit a sin.
 Therefore, since it is not a sin to refrain from sinning, it seems
 that ingratitude is not always a sin.

          </b>
          Gratitude regards a favor received: and he that helps another to commit a sin does him not a favor but an injury: and so no
 thanks are due to him, except perhaps on account of his good will,
 supposing him to have been deceived, and to have thought to help him
 in doing good, whereas he helped him to sin. In such a case the
 repayment due to him is not that he should be helped to commit a sin,
 because this would be repaying not good but evil, and this is
 contrary to gratitude.

          </b>
          Further, every sin is in the power of the person who commits it: because, according to Augustine (De Lib. Arb. iii; Retract. i),
 "no man sins in what he cannot avoid." Now sometimes it is not in the
 power of the sinner to avoid ingratitude, for instance when he has
 not the means of repaying. Again forgetfulness is not in our power,
 and yet Seneca declares (De Benef. iii) that "to forget a kindness is
 the height of ingratitude." Therefore ingratitude is not always a sin.

          </b>
          No man is excused from ingratitude through inability to repay, for the very reason that the mere will suffices for the
 repayment of the debt of gratitude, as stated above (Q. 106, A. 6, ad
 1).
 
 Forgetfulness of a favor received amounts to ingratitude, not indeed
 the forgetfulness that arises from a natural defect, that is not
 subject to the will, but that which arises from negligence. For, as
 Seneca observes (De Benef. iii), "when forgetfulness of favors lays
 hold of a man, he has apparently given little thought to their
 repayment."

          </b>
          Further, there would seem to be no repayment in being unwilling to owe anything, according to the Apostle (Rom. 13:8), "Owe
 no man anything." Yet "an unwilling debtor is ungrateful," as Seneca
 declares (De Benef. iv). Therefore ingratitude is not always a sin.

          The debt of gratitude flows from the debt of love, and from the latter no man should wish to be free. Hence that anyone
 should owe this debt unwillingly seems to arise from lack of love for
 his benefactor.

          Ingratitude is reckoned among other sins (2 Tim.

          3:2), where it is written: "Disobedient to parents, ungrateful,

          As stated above (Q. 106, A. 4, ad 1, A. 6) a debt of

          gratitude is a moral debt required by virtue. Now a thing is a sin
 from the fact of its being contrary to virtue. Wherefore it is
 evident that every ingratitude is a sin.

          It seems that ingratitude is not a special sin. For whoever sins acts against God his sovereign benefactor. But this
 pertains to ingratitude. Therefore ingratitude is not a special sin.

          </b>
          In every sin there is material ingratitude to God, inasmuch as a man does something that may pertain to ingratitude. But
 formal ingratitude is when a favor is actually contemned, and this is
 a special sin.

          Further, no special sin is contained under different kinds of sin. But one can be ungrateful by committing different kinds of sin,
 for instance by calumny, theft, or something similar committed
 against a benefactor. Therefore ingratitude is not a special sin.

          Nothing hinders the formal aspect of some special sin from being found materially in several kinds of sin, and in this way
 the aspect of ingratitude is to be found in many kinds of sin.

          Further, Seneca writes (De Benef. iii): "It is ungrateful to take no notice of a kindness, it is ungrateful not to repay one, but
 it is the height of ingratitude to forget it." Now these do not seem
 to belong to the same species of sin. Therefore ingratitude is not a
 special sin.

          Ingratitude is opposed to gratitude or

          thankfulness, which is a special virtue. Therefore it is a special
 sin.
 

          <br />
          <br />

            <i>
              Respondeo,
            </i>
          </b>
          Every vice is denominated from a deficiency of

          virtue, because deficiency is more opposed to virtue: thus
 illiberality is more opposed to liberality than prodigality is. Now a
 vice may be opposed to the virtue of gratitude by way of excess, for
 instance if one were to show gratitude for things for which gratitude
 is not due, or sooner than it is due, as stated above (Q. 106, A. 4).
 But still more opposed to gratitude is the vice denoting deficiency
 of gratitude, because the virtue of gratitude, as stated above (Q.
 106, A. 6), inclines to return something more. Wherefore ingratitude
 is properly denominated from being a deficiency of gratitude. Now
 every deficiency or privation takes its species from the opposite
 habit: for blindness and deafness differ according to the difference
 of sight and hearing. Therefore just as gratitude or thankfulness is
 one special virtue, so also is ingratitude one special sin.
 
 It has, however, various degrees corresponding in their order to the
 things required for gratitude. The first of these is to recognize the
 favor received, the second to express one's appreciation and thanks,
 and the third to repay the favor at a suitable place and time
 according to one's means. And since what is last in the order of
 generation is first in the order of destruction, it follows that the
 first degree of ingratitude is when a man fails to repay a favor, the
 second when he declines to notice or indicate that he has received a
 favor, while the third and supreme degree is when a man fails to
 recognize the reception of a favor, whether by forgetting it or in
 any other way. Moreover, since opposite affirmation includes
 negation, it follows that it belongs to the first degree of
 ingratitude to return evil for good, to the second to find fault with
 a favor received, and to the third to esteem kindness as though it
 were unkindness.

          It seems that ingratitude is always a mortal sin. For one ought to be grateful to God above all. But one is not ungrateful
 to God by committing a venial sin: else every man would be guilty of
 ingratitude. Therefore no ingratitude is a venial sin.

          </b>
          By committing a venial sin one is not ungrateful to God to the extent of incurring the guilt of perfect ingratitude: but
 there is something of ingratitude in a venial sin, in so far as it
 removes a virtuous act of obedience to God.

          Further, a sin is mortal through being contrary to charity, as stated above (Q. 24, A. 12). But ingratitude is contrary to
 charity, since the debt of gratitude proceeds from that virtue, as
 stated above (Q. 106, A. 1, ad 3; A. 6, ad 2). Therefore ingratitude
 is always a mortal sin.

          When ingratitude is a venial sin it is not contrary to, but beside charity: since it does not destroy the habit of charity,
 but excludes some act thereof.

          Further, Seneca says (De Benef. ii): "Between the giver and the receiver of a favor there is this law, that the former should
 forthwith forget having given, and the latter should never forget
 having received." Now, seemingly, the reason why the giver should
 forget is that he may be unaware of the sin of the recipient, should
 the latter prove ungrateful; and there would be no necessity for that
 if ingratitude were a slight sin. Therefore ingratitude is always a
 mortal sin.

          Seneca also says (De Benef. vii): "When we say that a man after conferring a favor should forget about it, it is a mistake
 to suppose that we mean him to shake off the recollection of a thing
 so very praiseworthy. When we say: He must not remember it, we mean
 that he must not publish it abroad and boast about it."

          _On the contrary,_ No one should be put in the way of committing a mortal sin. Yet, according to Seneca (De Benef. ii),
 "sometimes it is necessary to deceive the person who receives
 assistance, in order that he may receive without knowing from whom he
 has received." But this would seem to put the recipient in the way of
 ingratitude. Therefore ingratitude is not always a mortal sin.

          He that is unaware of a favor conferred on him is not ungrateful, if he fails to repay it, provided he be prepared to do so
 if he knew. It is nevertheless commendable at times that the object
 of a favor should remain in ignorance of it, both in order to avoid
 vainglory, as when Blessed Nicolas threw gold into a house secretly,
 wishing to avoid popularity: and because the kindness is all the
 greater through the benefactor wishing not to shame the person on
 whom he is conferring the favor.

          </b>
          As appears from what we have said above (A. 2), a

          man may be ungrateful in two ways: first, by mere omission, for
 instance by failing to recognize the favor received, or to express
 his appreciation of it or to pay something in return, and this is not
 always a mortal sin, because, as stated above (Q. 106, A. 6), the
 debt of gratitude requires a man to make a liberal return, which,
 however, he is not bound to do; wherefore if he fail to do so, he
 does not sin mortally. It is nevertheless a venial sin, because it
 arises either from some kind of negligence or from some
 disinclination to virtue in him. And yet ingratitude of this kind may
 happen to be a mortal sin, by reason either of inward contempt, or of
 the kind of thing withheld, this being needful to the benefactor,
 either simply, or in some case of necessity.
 
 Secondly, a man may be ungrateful, because he not only omits to pay
 the debt of gratitude, but does the contrary. This again is sometimes
 a mortal and sometimes a venial sin, according to the kind of thing
 that is done.
 
 It must be observed, however, that when ingratitude arises from a
 mortal sin, it has the perfect character of ingratitude, and when it
 arises from venial sin, it has the imperfect character.

          There are two points to be considered with regard to

          an ungrateful person. The first is what he deserves to suffer and
 thus it is certain that he deserves to be deprived of our favor. The
 second is, what ought his benefactor to do? For in the first place he
 should not easily judge him to be ungrateful, since, as Seneca
 remarks (De Benef. iii), "a man is often grateful although he repays
 not," because perhaps he has not the means or the opportunity of
 repaying. Secondly, he should be inclined to turn his ungratefulness
 into gratitude, and if he does not achieve this by being kind to him
 once, he may by being so a second time. If, however, the more he
 repeats his favors, the more ungrateful and evil the other becomes,
 he should cease from bestowing his favors upon him.
