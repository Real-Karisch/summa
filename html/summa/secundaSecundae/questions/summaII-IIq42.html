    <h1>QUESTION 42</h1>
    <h2>OF SEDITION (In Two Articles)
</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  <br />
  We must now consider sedition, under which head there are two points

  of inquiry:

  <br />
  (1) Whether it is a special sin?

  <br />
  (2) Whether it is a mortal sin?

          </b>
          It would seem that sedition is not a special sin distinct from other sins. For, according to Isidore (Etym. x), "a
 seditious man is one who sows dissent among minds, and begets
 discord." Now, by provoking the commission of a sin, a man sins by no
 other kind of sin than that which he provoked. Therefore it seems
 that sedition is not a special sin distinct from discord.

          </b>
          A seditious man is one who incites others to sedition, and since sedition denotes a kind of discord, it follows that a
 seditious man is one who creates discord, not of any kind, but
 between the parts of a multitude. And the sin of sedition is not only
 in him who sows discord, but also in those who dissent from one
 another inordinately.

          </b>
          Further, sedition denotes a kind of division. Now schism takes its name from scission, as stated above (Q. 39, A. 1).
 Therefore, seemingly, the sin of sedition is not distinct from that
 of schism.

          </b>
          Sedition differs from schism in two respects. First, because schism is opposed to the spiritual unity of the multitude,
 viz. ecclesiastical unity, whereas sedition is contrary to the
 temporal or secular unity of the multitude, for instance of a city or
 kingdom. Secondly, schism does not imply any preparation for a
 material fight as sedition does, but only for a spiritual dissent.

          </b>
          Further, every special sin that is distinct from other sins, is either a capital vice, or arises from some capital vice. Now
 sedition is reckoned neither among the capital vices, nor among those
 vices which arise from them, as appears from Moral. xxxi, 45, where
 both kinds of vice are enumerated. Therefore sedition is not a
 special sin, distinct from other sins.

          </b>
          Sedition, like schism, is contained under discord, since each is a kind of discord, not between individuals, but between
 the parts of a multitude.

          Seditions are mentioned as distinct from other

          sins (2 Cor. 12:20).

          </b>
          Sedition is a special sin, having something in

          common with war and strife, and differing somewhat from them. It has
 something in common with them, in so far as it implies a certain
 antagonism, and it differs from them in two points. First, because
 war and strife denote actual aggression on either side, whereas
 sedition may be said to denote either actual aggression, or the
 preparation for such aggression. Hence a gloss on 2 Cor. 12:20 says
 that "seditions are tumults tending to fight," when, to wit, a number
 of people make preparations with the intention of fighting. Secondly,
 they differ in that war is, properly speaking, carried on against
 external foes, being as it were between one people and another,
 whereas strife is between one individual and another, or between few
 people on one side and few on the other side, while sedition, in its
 proper sense, is between mutually dissentient parts of one people, as
 when one part of the state rises in tumult against another part.
 Wherefore, since sedition is opposed to a special kind of good,
 namely the unity and peace of a people, it is a special kind of sin.

Whether Sedition Is Always a Mortal Sin?

          </b>
          It would seem that sedition is not always a mortal sin. For sedition denotes "a tumult tending to fight," according to the
 gloss quoted above (A. 1). But fighting is not always a mortal sin,
 indeed it is sometimes just and lawful, as stated above (Q. 40, A.
 1). Much more, therefore, can sedition be without a mortal sin.

          It is lawful to fight, provided it be for the common good, as stated above (Q. 40, A. 1). But sedition runs counter to the
 common good of the multitude, so that it is always a mortal sin.

          </b>
          Further, sedition is a kind of discord, as stated above (A. 1, ad 3). Now discord can be without mortal sin, and sometimes
 without any sin at all. Therefore sedition can be also.

          Discord from what is not evidently good, may be without sin, but discord from what is evidently good, cannot be without sin:
 and sedition is discord of this kind, for it is contrary to the unity
 of the multitude, which is a manifest good.

          Further, it is praiseworthy to deliver a multitude from a tyrannical rule. Yet this cannot easily be done without some
 dissension in the multitude, if one part of the multitude seeks to
 retain the tyrant, while the rest strive to dethrone him. Therefore
 there can be sedition without mortal sin.

          A tyrannical government is not just, because it is directed, not to the common good, but to the private good of the
 ruler, as the Philosopher states (Polit. iii, 5; _Ethic._ viii, 10).
 Consequently there is no sedition in disturbing a government of this
 kind, unless indeed the tyrant's rule be disturbed so inordinately,
 that his subjects suffer greater harm from the consequent disturbance
 than from the tyrant's government. Indeed it is the tyrant rather
 that is guilty of sedition, since he encourages discord and sedition
 among his subjects, that he may lord over them more securely; for
 this is tyranny, being conducive to the private good of the ruler,
 and to the injury of the multitude.

          </b>
          The Apostle forbids seditions together with other

          things that are mortal sins (2 Cor. 12:20).
 

          <br />
          <br />
          <b>
            <i>
              Respondeo,
            </i>
          </b>
          As stated above (A. 1, ad 2), sedition is contrary

          to the unity of the multitude, viz. the people of a city or kingdom.
 Now Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ii, 21) that "wise men understand the
 word people to designate not any crowd of persons, but the assembly
 of those who are united together in fellowship recognized by law and
 for the common good." Wherefore it is evident that the unity to which
 sedition is opposed is the unity of law and common good: whence it
 follows manifestly that sedition is opposed to justice and the common
 good. Therefore by reason of its genus it is a mortal sin, and its
 gravity will be all the greater according as the common good which it
 assails surpasses the private good which is assailed by strife.
 
 Accordingly the sin of sedition is first and chiefly in its authors,
 who sin most grievously; and secondly it is in those who are led by
 them to disturb the common good. Those, however, who defend the
 common good, and withstand the seditious party, are not themselves
 seditious, even as neither is a man to be called quarrelsome because
 he defends himself, as stated above (Q. 41, A. 1).
