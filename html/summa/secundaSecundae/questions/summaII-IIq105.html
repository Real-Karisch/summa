    <h1>QUESTION 105</h1>
    <h2>OF DISOBEDIENCE (In Two Articles)
</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  <br />
  We must now consider disobedience, under which head there are two

  points of inquiry:

  <br />
  (1) Whether it is a mortal sin?

  <br />
  (2) Whether it is the most grievous of sins?

            </i>
          </b>
          It seems that disobedience is not a mortal sin. For every sin is a disobedience, as appears from Ambrose's definition
 given above (Q. 104, A. 2, Obj. 1). Therefore if disobedience were a
 mortal sin, every sin would be mortal.

          </b>
          The definition given by Ambrose refers to mortal sin, which has the character of perfect sin. Venial sin is not
 disobedience, because it is not contrary to a precept, but beside it.
 Nor again is every mortal sin disobedience, properly and essentially,
 but only when one contemns a precept, since moral acts take their
 species from the end. And when a thing is done contrary to a precept,
 not in contempt of the precept, but with some other purpose, it is
 not a sin of disobedience except materially, and belongs formally to
 another species of sin.

          </b>
          Further, Gregory says (Moral. xxxi) that disobedience is born of vainglory. But vainglory is not a mortal sin. Neither therefore is
 disobedience.

          </b>
          Vainglory desires display of excellence. And since it seems to point to a certain excellence that one be not subject to
 another's command, it follows that disobedience arises from
 vainglory. But there is nothing to hinder mortal sin from arising out
 of venial sin, since venial sin is a disposition to mortal.

          </b>
          Further, a person is said to be disobedient when he does not fulfil a superior's command. But superiors often issue so many
 commands that it is seldom, if ever, possible to fulfil them.
 Therefore if disobedience were a mortal sin, it would follow that man
 cannot avoid mortal sin, which is absurd. Wherefore disobedience is
 not a mortal sin.

          No one is bound to do the impossible: wherefore if a superior makes a heap of precepts and lays them upon his subjects, so
 that they are unable to fulfil them, they are excused from sin.
 Wherefore superiors should refrain from making a multitude of
 precepts.

          The sin of disobedience to parents is reckoned

          (Rom. 1:30; 2 Tim. 3:2) among other mortal sins.

            <i>
              Respondeo,
            </i>
          </b>
          As stated above (Q. 24, A. 12; I-II, Q. 72, A. 5;

          I-II, Q. 88, A. 1), a mortal sin is one that is contrary to charity
 which is the cause of spiritual life. Now by charity we love God and
 our neighbor. The charity of God requires that we obey His
 commandments, as stated above (Q. 24, A. 12). Therefore to be
 disobedient to the commandments of God is a mortal sin, because it is
 contrary to the love of God.
 
 Again, the commandments of God contain the precept of obedience to
 superiors. Wherefore also disobedience to the commands of a superior
 is a mortal sin, as being contrary to the love of God, according to
 Rom. 13:2, "He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of
 God." It is also contrary to the love of our neighbor, as it
 withdraws from the superior who is our neighbor the obedience that is
 his due.

Whether Disobedience Is the Most Grievous of Sins?

            <i>
              Objection 1:
            </i>
          </b>
          It seems that disobedience is the most grievous of sins. For it is written (1 Kings 15:23): "It is like the sin of witchcraft
 to rebel, and like the crime of idolatry to refuse to obey." But
 idolatry is the most grievous of sins, as stated above (Q. 94, A. 3).
 Therefore disobedience is the most grievous of sins.

          </b>
          This comparison of Samuel is one, not of equality but of likeness, because disobedience redounds to the contempt of God
 just as idolatry does, though the latter does so more.

          </b>
          Further, the sin against the Holy Ghost is one that removes the obstacles of sin, as stated above (Q. 14, A. 2). Now disobedience
 makes a man contemn a precept which, more than anything, prevents a
 man from sinning. Therefore disobedience is a sin against the Holy
 Ghost, and consequently is the most grievous of sins.

          </b>
          Not every disobedience is sin against the Holy Ghost, but only that which obstinacy is added: for it is not the contempt of
 any obstacle to sin that constitutes sin against the Holy Ghost, else
 the contempt of any good would be a sin against the Holy Ghost, since
 any good may hinder a man from committing sin. The sin against the
 Holy Ghost consists in the contempt of those goods which lead
 directly to repentance and the remission of sins.

          Further, the Apostle says (Rom. 5:19) that "by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners." Now the cause is
 seemingly greater than its effect. Therefore disobedience seems to be
 a more grievous sin than the others that are caused thereby.

          The first sin of our first parent, from which sin was transmitted to all men, was not disobedience considered as a special
 sin, but pride, from which then man proceeded to disobey. Hence the
 Apostle in these words seems to take disobedience in its relation to
 every sin.

          Contempt of the commander is a more grievous sin

          than contempt of his command. Now some sins are against the very
 person of the commander, such as blasphemy and murder. Therefore
 disobedience is not the most grievous of sins.

          </b>
          Not every disobedience is equally a sin: for one

          disobedience may be greater than another, in two ways. First, on the
 part of the superior commanding, since, although a man should take
 every care to obey each superior, yet it is a greater duty to obey a
 higher than a lower authority, in sign of which the command of a
 lower authority is set aside if it be contrary to the command of a
 higher authority. Consequently the higher the person who commands,
 the more grievous is it to disobey him: so that it is more grievous
 to disobey God than man. Secondly, on the part of the things
 commanded. For the person commanding does not equally desire the
 fulfilment of all his commands: since every such person desires above
 all the end, and that which is nearest to the end. Wherefore
 disobedience is the more grievous, according as the unfulfilled
 commandment is more in the intention of the person commanding. As to
 the commandments of God, it is evident that the greater the good
 commanded, the more grievous the disobedience of that commandment,
 because since God's will is essentially directed to the good, the
 greater the good the more does God wish it to be fulfilled.
 Consequently he that disobeys the commandment of the love of God sins
 more grievously than one who disobeys the commandment of the love of
 our neighbor. On the other hand, man's will is not always directed to
 the greater good: hence, when we are bound by a mere precept of man,
 a sin is more grievous, not through setting aside a greater good, but
 through setting aside that which is more in the intention of the
 person commanding.
 
 Accordingly the various degrees of disobedience must correspond with
 the various degrees of precepts: because the disobedience in which
 there is contempt of God's precept, from the very nature of
 disobedience is more grievous than a sin committed against a man,
 apart from the latter being a disobedience to God. And I say this
 because whoever sins against his neighbor acts also against God's
 commandment. And if the divine precept be contemned in a yet graver
 matter, the sin is still more grievous. The disobedience that
 contains contempt of a man's precept is less grievous than the sin
 which contemns the man who made the precept, because reverence for
 the person commanding should give rise to reverence for his command.
 In like manner a sin that directly involves contempt of God, such as
 blasphemy, or the like, is more grievous (even if we mentally
 separate the disobedience from the sin) than would be a sin involving
 contempt of God's commandment alone.
