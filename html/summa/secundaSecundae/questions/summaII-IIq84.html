    <h1>QUESTION 84</h1>
    <h2>OF ADORATION (In Three Articles) 
</h2>
  </div>
  <br />
  In due sequence we must consider the external acts of latria, and in

  the first place, adoration whereby one uses one's body to reverence

  God; secondly, those acts whereby some external thing is offered to

  God; thirdly, those acts whereby something belonging to God is

  assumed.

  <br />
  Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:

  <br />
  (1) Whether adoration is an act of latria?

  <br />
  (2) Whether adoration denotes an internal or an external act?

  <br />
  (3) Whether adoration requires a definite place?

  <br />

              Objection 1:
            </i>
          </b>
          It would seem that adoration is not an act of latria or religion. The worship of religion is due to God alone. But adoration
 is not due to God alone: since we read (Gen. 18:2) that Abraham
 adored the angels; and (3 Kings 1:23) that the prophet Nathan, when
 he was come in to king David, "worshiped him bowing down to the
 ground." Therefore adoration is not an act of religion.

          </b>
          Reverence is due to God on account of His excellence, which is communicated to certain creatures not in equal measure, but
 according to a measure of proportion; and so the reverence which we
 pay to God, and which belongs to latria, differs from the reverence
 which we pay to certain excellent creatures; this belongs to dulia,
 and we shall speak of it further on (Q. 103). And since external
 actions are signs of internal reverence, certain external tokens
 significative of reverence are offered to creatures of excellence,
 and among these tokens the chief is adoration: yet there is one thing
 which is offered to God alone, and that is sacrifice. Hence Augustine
 says (De Civ. Dei x, 4): "Many tokens of Divine worship are employed
 in doing honor to men, either through excessive humility, or through
 pernicious flattery; yet so that those to whom these honors are given
 are recognized as being men to whom we owe esteem and reverence and
 even adoration if they be far above us. But who ever thought it his
 duty to sacrifice to any other than one whom he either knew or deemed
 or pretended to be a God?" Accordingly it was with the reverence due
 to an excellent creature that Nathan adored David; while it was the
 reverence due to God with which Mardochai refused to adore Aman
 fearing "lest he should transfer the honor of his God to a man"
 (Esther 13:14).
 
 Again with the reverence due to an excellent creature Abraham adored
 the angels, as did also Josue (Jos. 5:15): though we may understand
 them to have adored, with the adoration of latria, God Who appeared
 and spoke to them in the guise of an angel. It was with the reverence
 due to God that John was forbidden to adore the angel (Apoc. 22:9),
 both to indicate the dignity which he had acquired through Christ,
 whereby man is made equal to an angel: wherefore the same text goes
 on: "I am thy fellow-servant and of thy brethren"; as also to exclude
 any occasion of idolatry, wherefore the text continues: "Adore God."

          </b>
          Further, the worship of religion is due to God as the object of beatitude, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei x, 3): whereas
 adoration is due to Him by reason of His majesty, since a gloss on
 Ps. 28:2, "Adore ye the Lord in His holy court," says: "We pass from
 these courts into the court where we adore His majesty." Therefore
 adoration is not an act of latria.

          Every Divine excellency is included in His majesty: to which it pertains that we should be made happy in Him as in the
 sovereign good.

          </b>
          Further, the worship of one same religion is due to the three Persons. But we do not adore the three Persons with one adoration,
 for we genuflect at each separate invocation of Them [*At the
 adoration of the Cross, on Good Friday]. Therefore adoration is nol
 an act of latria.
 

          <br />

              Reply Objection 3:
            </i>
          </b>
          Since there is one excellence of the three Divine Persons, one honor and reverence is due to them and
 consequently one adoration. It is to represent this that where it is
 related (Gen. 18:2) that three men appeared to Abraham, we are told
 that he addressed one, saying: "Lord, if I have found favor in thy
 sight," etc. The triple genuflection represents the Trinity of
 Persons, not a difference of adoration.

          Adoration is directed to the reverence of the person

          adored. Now it is evident from what we have said (Q. 81, AA. 2, 4)
 that it is proper to religion to show reverence to God. Hence the
 adoration whereby we adore God is an act of religion.

          </b>
          It would seem that adoration does not denote an act of the body. It is written (John 4:23): "The true adorers shall adore
 the Father in spirit and in truth." Now what is done in spirit has
 nothing to do with an act of the body. Therefore adoration does not
 denote an act of the body.

          </b>
          Further, the word adoration is taken from _oratio_ (prayer). But prayer consists chiefly in an interior act, according to 1 Cor.
 14:15, "I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the
 understanding." Therefore adoration denotes chiefly a spiritual act.
 

          <br />

          Just as prayer is primarily in the mind, and secondarily expressed in words, as stated above (Q. 83, A. 12), so
 too adoration consists chiefly in an interior reverence of God, but
 secondarily in certain bodily signs of humility; thus when we
 genuflect we signify our weakness in comparison with God, and when we
 prostrate ourselves we profess that we are nothing of ourselves.

          Though we cannot reach God with the senses, our mind is urged by sensible signs to approach God.

          </b>
          As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 12), since we

          are composed of a twofold nature, intellectual and sensible, we offer
 God a twofold adoration; namely, a spiritual adoration, consisting in
 the internal devotion of the mind; and a bodily adoration, which
 consists in an exterior humbling of the body. And since in all acts
 of latria that which is without is referred to that which is within
 as being of greater import, it follows that exterior adoration is
 offered on account of interior adoration, in other words we exhibit
 signs of humility in our bodies in order to incite our affections to
 submit to God, since it is connatural to us to proceed from the
 sensible to the intelligible.

          It would seem that adoration does not require a definite place. It is written (John 4:21): "The hour cometh, when you shall
 neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, adore the Father"; and
 the same reason seems to apply to other places. Therefore a definite
 place is not necessary for adoration.

          By these words our Lord foretold the cessation of adoration, both according to the rite of the Jews who adored in
 Jerusalem, and according to the rite of the Samaritans who adored on
 Mount Garizim. For both these rites ceased with the advent of the
 spiritual truth of the Gospel, according to which "a sacrifice is
 offered to God in every place," as stated in Malach. 1:11.

          Further, exterior adoration is directed to interior adoration. But interior adoration is shown to God as existing
 everywhere. Therefore exterior adoration does not require a definite

          A definite place is chosen for adoration, not on account of God Who is adored, as though He were enclosed in a place,
 but on account of the adorers; and this for three reasons. First,
 because the place is consecrated, so that those who pray there
 conceive a greater devotion and are more likely to be heard, as may
 be seen in the prayer of Solomon (3 Kings 8). Secondly, on account of
 the sacred mysteries and other signs of holiness contained therein.
 Thirdly, on account of the concourse of many adorers, by reason of
 which their prayer is more likely to be heard, according to Matt.
 18:20, "Where there are two or three gathered together in My name,
 there am I in the midst of them."

          Further, the same God is adored in the New as in the Old Testament. Now in the Old Testament they adored towards the west,
 because the door of the Tabernacle looked to the east (Ex. 26:18
 seqq.). Therefore for the same reason we ought now to adore towards
 the west, if any definite place be requisite for adoration.

          There is a certain fittingness in adoring towards the east. First, because the Divine majesty is indicated in the movement
 of the heavens which is from the east. Secondly, because Paradise was
 situated in the east according to the Septuagint version of Gen. 2:8,
 and so we signify our desire to return to Paradise. Thirdly, on
 account of Christ Who is "the light of the world" [*John 8:12; 9:5],
 and is called "the Orient" (Zech. 6:12); "Who mounteth above the
 heaven of heavens to the east" (Ps. 67:34), and is expected to come
 from the east, according to Matt. 24:27, "As lightning cometh out of
 the east, and appeareth even into the west; so shall also the coming
 of the Son of Man be."

          As stated above (A. 2), the chief part of adoration

          is the internal devotion of the mind, while the secondary part is
 something external pertaining to bodily signs. Now the mind
 internally apprehends God as not comprised in a place; while bodily
 signs must of necessity be in some definite place and position. Hence
 a definite place is required for adoration, not chiefly, as though it
 were essential thereto, but by reason of a certain fittingness, like
 other bodily signs.
